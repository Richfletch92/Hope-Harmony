    - Light purple: #b5a7ce
    - Dark purple: #aa85c9
    - Peach: #f1e5e5
    - Pink: #debec5
    - Grey: #aeaeb6
    - Dark pink: #c28ba9

- **Fonts**: I used 2 different fonts on the site one for the headers and the other for all other text. I picked fonts which are easy to read and of a calming nature. The fonts are listed below.
    - Main font: [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) and serif
    - Header font: [Poiret One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One) and sans-serif

- **Images**: I used [Leonardo AI](https://leonardo.ai) and [Co-pilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/images/create) to generate the hero image and profile pictures for my about us page. The Logos were sourced mostly from each companies website they're listed further below. I also used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for the card images on the Home page. I made my favicons using [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

## AI Overview

AI was used throughout my project. Some areas of code was generated using Co-Pilot, it was also used for debugging purposes however it did still miss some errors. I did find it very helpful to generate blocks of basic code which saved time allowing me to focous in other areas. I also used AI to generate the information on my page to save time having to research. It was also used to generate a lot of images. 


## Things to be Improved
